The database stores information about its members. Each member can be associated with 1 or more school.

You should build a demo that allows someone to add a new member with the fields “Name”, “Email Address” and "School" (selected from a list). The demo should display all members for a selected school.   

The primary language we use is PHP and we use an MVC framework so please use this in your coding test.
